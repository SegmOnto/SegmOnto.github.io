# SegmOnto: A Controlled Vocabulary to Describe the Layout of Pages

SegmOnto offers a controlled vocabulary to describe the content of books or manuscripts pages, in order to homogenise the data required by layout analysers. This project follows a double objective:

- Mutualise data to train stronger models on various layouts.
- Design a standardised pipeline for text extraction, from page scans to structured documents

SegmOnto is thought as a generalist description scheme, covering written documents produced since the apparition of the codex, but it has been designed using mainly western and middle eastern documents.
