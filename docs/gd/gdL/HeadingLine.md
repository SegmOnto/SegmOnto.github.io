# `HeadingLine`

## 1. Definition

**HeadingLine:** is a line containing any type of heading, which is defined as a string with a distinctive typesetting (font, size, colour, capitalisation…) different than that seen in the body of the text. It is not limited to the header. Rather the `HeadingLine` indicates the beginning of a new unit, no matter the unit's size, such as a medieval rubric, a speaker's name in a play, or the title of a poem in a collection. It is also used in the `TitlePageZone`.

⚠️ Because a closer is often similar to a header, you can also use `HeadingLine` for closing formulas (e.g. in a letter).

⚠️ Distinguishing all the types of title can be complicated if there are a very large number of them.

## 2. Subtypes

Suggested values include:

- `HeadingLine:rubric`
- `HeadingLine:title`
